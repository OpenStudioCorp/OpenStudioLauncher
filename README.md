# OpenStudioLauncher!

welcome to the official launcher made by and with members of OpenStudio and OpenStudioCorporation.

you might be thinking, where is all the files?

due to error with github, the windows port of the launcher is located on window-port instead of the windows-port branch.

it also makes it better for us to make documentation for our software!

using the branch selector you can select from the linux port and the windows one!

but please note, unless theres a release for a new version, it's in very early development!
